# Assessing the Blue Planet: A Comprehensive Study of Global Water Resources

## Getting started

### Prepare the environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

**Important:**

Make sure that your IDE uses the virtual environment.
In PyCharm, for example, you can set the Python interpreter in `Settings > Project > Project Interpreter`.
The interpreter for the virtual environment is located in `env/bin/python`.

### Deactivate the environment

```
deactivate
```
